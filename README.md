# Project Proposal

### Project title

Scrum-based Task Management System

### What and why?

For people who have issues with procrastination, or are struggling to manage a large workload, this software will have you list out all of your tasks to complete, like a project backlog, help you divide them into smaller chunks, and act as a to-do list.

### For whom?

This software is for anyone who wants to improve their workflow efficiency. However, we will primarily target students, who have classwork/studying to complete.

### How?

1. From an end-user perspective, they will list out everything they have to do (user stories). For example, Bob has to complete 2 chapters of readings, homework for two classes, and one essay in two days.

2. Then, the application will take the user through a questionare that serves as an estimation of effort, priority ranking, timeline, goals, as well as dividing the tasks into smaller tasks if nessesary.

3. Based on this, the program will use an algorithm or an AI assistant to divide and order the work for you to complete in 30-90 minute intervals, that the user will use as a task management tool to stay on track. This can include a timer to encourage the user to stay on track There will be a Scrum board with columns like Backlog, To-Do, In Progress, and Done to monitor progress and work that still needs to be done.
Allow users to create, edit, and prioritize tasks or user stories on the board.

4. After every task or subtask, it will take input into whether you completed your task or how much you completed/did not complete, and return it into the backlog, and potentially modify the task/time interval based on feedback.


### Scope

This project must have a clean front-end that is simple, easy to use, and encourages productivity. We need to figure out how to create and divide up the work with our application, implement a to-do list, as well as take user input to edit and create the backlog.

 I also beleive that much of the product will have to be tweaked or improved through user feedback throughout the semester. Because of this, I beleive that this project will be a reasonable challenge to undertake throughout the semester 

Additionally, we could add other features such as user authentication, analytics, etc if it proves to be too easy.
